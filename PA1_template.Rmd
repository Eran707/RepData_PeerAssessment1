## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
df_data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
summary(df_data)
#head(df_data)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r,echo=TRUE}
na_mask <- !is.na(df_data[,'steps']) 
df_steps <- df_data[na_mask,]
df_steps[,'steps'] <- as.numeric(df_steps[,'steps'])

summary(df_steps)
mean_steps_per_day <- lapply(split(df_steps[,'steps'],df_steps[,'date']),mean)
length(mean_steps_per_day)
dates<- unique(df_steps[,'date'])
length(dates)
#print(mean_steps_per_day)
plot(dates,mean_steps_per_day)
#ggplot(df_steps,aes(x=df_steps[,'date'])) + geom_histogram(aes(y=mean_steps_per_day))
```
## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
